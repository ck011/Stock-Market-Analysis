# Stock-Market-Analysis
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project related to Exploratory data analysis(EDA), Data visualization and Predictive analysis using data, provided by The Investors Exchange (IEX). I looked at real-time financial data from the stock market. I have used python libraries to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I have also used statistical method called Monte Carlo Method to predict future stock prices.
